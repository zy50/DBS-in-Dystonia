 -- Codelist: (No need to run this separately) Macro variables for diagnosis and procedure codes.
 -- Format: (No need to run this separately) Formats defined for this project.
 -- weightedtable: (No need to run this separately) Macro used to create weighted Table 1 and other summary tables.

NOTE: If you do not have PC SAS on your computer, right click the file, check "Open with" and choose "Notepad".
